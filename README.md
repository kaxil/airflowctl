`airflowctl` is a command-line tool for managing Apache Airflow™ projects.
It provides a set of commands to initialize, build, start, stop, and manage Airflow projects.
With `airflowctl`, you can easily set up and manage your Airflow projects, install
specific versions of Apache Airflow, and manage virtual environments.

The main goal of `airflowctl` is for first-time Airflow users to install and setup Airflow using a single command and
for existing Airflow users to manage multiple Airflow projects with different Airflow versions on the same machine.

## Features

- **Project Initialization with Connections & Variables:** Initialize a new Airflow project with customizable project name, Apache Airflow
version, and Python version. It also allows you to manage Airflow connections and variables.
- **Automatic Virtual Environment Management:** Automatically create and manage virtual environments for
your Airflow projects, even for Python versions that are not installed on your system.
- **Airflow Version Management:** Install and manage specific versions of Apache Airflow.
- **Background Process Management:** Start and stop Airflow in the background with process management capabilities.
- **Live Logs Display:** Continuously display live logs of background Airflow processes with optional log filtering.

## Installation

```bash
pip install airflowctl
```

## Quickstart

To initialize a new Airflow project with the latest airflow version, build a Virtual environment
and run the project, run the following command:

```shell
airflowctl init my_airflow_project --build-start
```

This will start Airflow and display the logs in the terminal. You can
access the Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080. To stop Airflow, press `Ctrl+C`.

## Usage

### Step 1: Initialize a New Project

To create a new Apache Airflow project, use the init command.
This command sets up the basic project structure, including configuration files,
directories, and sample DAGs.


```shell
airflowctl init <project_name> --airflow-version <version> --python-version <version>
```

Example:

```shell
airflowctl init my_airflow_project --airflow-version 2.6.3 --python-version 3.8
```

This creates a new project directory with the following structure:

```shell
my_airflow_project
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── dags
│   └── example_dag_basic.py
├── plugins
├── requirements.txt
└── settings.yaml
```

Description of the files and directories:
- `.env` file contains the environment variables for the project.
- `.gitignore` file contains the default gitignore settings.
- `dags` directory contains the sample DAGs.
- `plugins` directory contains the sample plugins.
- `requirements.txt` file contains the project dependencies.
- `settings.yaml` file contains the project settings, including the project name,
Airflow version, Python version, and virtual environment path.

In our example `settings.yaml` file would look like this:

```yaml
# Airflow version to be installed
airflow_version: "2.6.3"

# Python version for the project
python_version: "3.8"


# Path to a virtual environment to be used for the project
mode:
  virtualenv:
    venv_path: "PROJECT_DIR/.venv"

# Airflow connections
connections:
    # Example connection
    # - conn_id: example
    #   conn_type: http
    #   host: http://example.com
    #   port: 80
    #   login: user
    #   password: pass
    #   schema: http
    #   extra:
    #      example_extra_field: example-value

# Airflow variables
variables:
    # Example variable
    # - key: example
    #   value: example-value
    #   description: example-description
```

Edit the `settings.yaml` file to customize the project settings.

### Step 2: Build the Project

The build command creates the virtual environment, installs the specified Apache Airflow
version, and sets up the project dependencies.

Run the build command from the project directory:

```shell
cd my_airflow_project
airflowctl build
```

The CLI relies on [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to download and install a Python version if the version is not already installed.

Example, if you have Python 3.8 installed but you specify Python 3.7 in the `settings.yaml` file,
the CLI will install Python 3.7 using `pyenv` and create a virtual environment with Python 3.7 first.

Optionally, you can choose custom virtual environment path in case you have already installed apache-airflow package
and other dependencies.
Pass the existing virtualenv path using `--venv_path` option to the `init` command or in `settings.yaml` file.
Make sure the existing virtualenv has same airflow and python version as your `settings.yaml` file states.

### Step 3: Start Airflow

To start Airflow services, use the start command.
This command activates the virtual environment and launches the Airflow web server and scheduler.

Example:

```shell
airflowctl start my_airflow_project
```

You can also start Airflow in the background with the `--background` flag:

```shell
airflowctl start my_airflow_project --background
```

### Step 4: Monitor Logs

To monitor logs from the background Airflow processes, use the logs command.
This command displays live logs and provides options to filter logs for specific components.

Example
```shell
airflowctl logs my_airflow_project
```

To filter logs for specific components:

```shell
# Filter logs for scheduler
airflowctl logs my_airflow_project -s

# Filter logs for webserver
airflowctl logs my_airflow_project -w

# Filter logs for triggerer
airflowctl logs my_airflow_project -t

# Filter logs for scheduler and webserver
airflowctl logs my_airflow_project -s -w
```

### Step 5: Stop Airflow

To stop Airflow services if they are still running, use the stop command.

Example:

```shell
airflowctl stop my_airflow_project
```

### Step 6: List Airflow Projects

To list all Airflow projects, use the list command.

Example:

```shell
airflowctl list
```

### Step 7: Show Project Info

To show project info, use the info command.

Example:

```shell
# From the project directory
airflowctl info

# From outside the project directory
airflowctl info my_airflow_project
```

### Step 8: Running Airflow commands

To run Airflow commands, use the `airflowctl airflow` command. All the commands after
`airflowctl airflow` are passed to the Airflow CLI.:

```shell
# From the project directory
airflowctl airflow <airflow_command>
```

Example:

```shell
$ airflowctl airflow version
2.6.3
```

You can also run `airflowctl airflow --help` to see the list of available commands.

```shell
$ airflowctl airflow --help
Usage: airflowctl airflow [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Run Airflow commands.

Positional Arguments:
  GROUP_OR_COMMAND

    Groups:
      celery         Celery components

    Commands:
      cheat-sheet    Display cheat sheet
      dag-processor  Start a standalone Dag Processor instance
      info           Show information about current Airflow and environment
      kerberos       Start a kerberos ticket renewer
      plugins        Dump information about loaded plugins
      rotate-fernet-key
                     Rotate encrypted connection credentials and variables
      scheduler      Start a scheduler instance
      standalone     Run an all-in-one copy of Airflow
      sync-perm      Update permissions for existing roles and optionally DAGs
      triggerer      Start a triggerer instance
      version        Show the version
      webserver      Start a Airflow webserver instance

Options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
```

Example:

```shell
# Listing dags
$ airflowctl airflow dags list
dag_id            | filepath             | owner   | paused
==================+======================+=========+=======
example_dag_basic | example_dag_basic.py | airflow | True


# Running standalone
$ airflowctl airflow standalone
```

Or you can activate the virtual environment first and then run the commands as shown below.

Example:

```shell
# From the project directory
source .venv/bin/activate

# Source all the environment variables
source .env
airflow version
```

To add a new DAG, add the DAG file to the `dags` directory.

To edit an existing DAG, edit the DAG file in the `dags` directory.
The changes will be reflected in the Airflow web server.

### Step 9: Changing Airflow Configurations

`airflowctl` by default uses SQLite as the backend database and `SequentialExecutor` as the executor.
However, if you want to use other databases or executors, you can stop the project and
either a) edit the `airflow.cfg` file or b) add environment variables to the `.env` file.

Example:

```shell
# Stop the project
airflowctl stop my_airflow_project

# Changing the executor to LocalExecutor
# Change the database to PostgreSQL if you already have it installed
echo "AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@localhost:5432/airflow" >> .env
echo "AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=LocalExecutor" >> .env

# Start the project

airflowctl start my_airflow_project
```

Check the [Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html)
for all the available Airflow configurations.

#### Using Local Executor with SQLite
For Airflow >= 2.6, you can run `LocalExecutor` with `sqlite` as the backend database by
adding the following environment variable to the `.env` file:

```shell
_AIRFLOW__SKIP_DATABASE_EXECUTOR_COMPATIBILITY_CHECK=1
AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=LocalExecutor
```

This should automatically happen for you when you run `airflowctl airflow` command if
Airflow version `==2.6.*`.

> [!WARNING]
> Sqlite is not recommended for production use. Use it only for development and testing only.

### Other Commands

For more information and options, you can use the `--help` flag with each command.

## Using with other Airflow tools

`airflowctl` can be used with other Airflow projects as long as the project structure is the same.

### Astro CLI

`airflowctl` can be used with [Astro CLI](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli) projects too.

While `airflowctl` is a tool that allows you to run Airflow locally using virtual environments, Astro CLI
allows you to run Airflow locally using docker.

`airflowctl` can read the `airflow_settings.yaml` file generated by Astro CLI for reading connections & variables. It
will then re-use it as `settings` file for `airflowctl`.

For example, if you have an Astro CLI project:
- Run the `airflowctl init . --build-start` command to initialize `airflowctl` from the project directory.
Press `y` to continue when prompted.
- It will then ask you for the Airflow version, enter the version you are using, by
default uses the latest Airflow version, press enter to continue
- It will use the installed Python version as the project's python version. If you
want to use a different Python version, you can specify it in the `airflow_settings.yaml` file in the
`python_version` field.

```shell
# From the project directory
$ cd astro_project
$ airflowctl init . --build-start
Directory /Users/xyz/astro_project is not empty. Continue? [y/N]: y
Project /Users/xyz/astro_project added to tracking.
Airflow project initialized in /Users/xyz/astro_project
Detected Astro project. Using Astro settings file (/Users/kaxilnaik/Desktop/proj1/astro_project/airflow_settings.yaml).
'airflow_version' not found in airflow_settings.yaml file. What is the Airflow version? [2.6.3]:
Virtual environment created at /Users/xyz/astro_project/.venv
...
...
```

If you see an error like the following, remove `airflow.cfg` file from the project directory and remove
`AIRFLOW_HOME` from `.env` file if it exists and try again.

```shell
Error: there might be a problem with your project starting up.
The webserver health check timed out after 1m0s but your project will continue trying to start.
Run 'astro dev logs --webserver | --scheduler' for details.
```
